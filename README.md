# What you will learn from this workshop?
Penetration testing, also known as Pen Test, is the most common technique for testing the security of web applications. Web Application Penetration Testing involves simulating internal or external unauthorised attacks to gain access to sensitive data.

With a two-day intensive workshop, we will go from "I don't even know how to install it" to actually understanding web application pentest. You will study and practise Web Pentest across multiple modules. Using Portswigger, bWapp and DVWA labs, we will conduct live pentests and provide step-by-step instruction.

# Requirements
The following are hardware and software recommendations:

    - Linux / Windows / Mac Operating System
    - Oracle VirtualBox / VMware Workstation (in a recent version)
    - 25 GB of storage on your hard drive
    - > 4 GB RAM

We use one platform with all you need here:
- [Portswigger Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) has very nice learning resources on their website. Basically, everything required to get started is there.

# Setup
The following are how to setup for our workshop labs
- [Kali Linux](https://github.com/g3nj1z/web-pentest-beginner-workshop/blob/main/Setup/kalilinux.md)
- [Burpsuite](test)
- [Portswigger Academy](https://github.com/g3nj1z/web-pentest-beginner-workshop/blob/main/Setup/portswiggeracademy.md)
